# A Web Developer's Colour Picker

## Description

Just a simple colour picker, intended to help with design decisions. I find it helps me to have little colour palette collections while designing, and none that I have seen gave me the added benefit of a copyable list, already commented out so that I can quickly flip through them in CSS to see which looks best with my project. 

The application uses local storage to keep your own list of colours, in rows or columns of 5, depending on your browser viewport, and you can individually delete or clear all as needed. 

Please bear in mind that the colour dropper API does not at this stage have great compatibiity, and only works with HTTPS. See below for compatibility as shown by mdn web docs:

I don't know whether it will be of benefit to anyone but me, but feel free to use if it's useful :)

## Installation

No installation necessary. Web application, can be accessed via the URL on your browser as needed.

## Usage

- Click on the 'Open Eyedropper' button and use it to select a colour from anywhere on your screen. 
- Collect as many as you like and delete whichever you don't need anymore. 
- The colours will be stored until you delete them using individual delete buttons, or until you clear your local storage. 
- To clear your entire selection click on 'Clear History'. 
- To copy the list of hex codes, click on the 'Copy Colour List' button, and paste into your css code wherever needed. 
- The code is already commented out, so uncomment each individal line as needed, to see how it looks.
